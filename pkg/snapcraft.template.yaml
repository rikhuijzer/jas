# To get the login:
#
# $ snapcraft login
#
# $ snapcraft register jas
# 
# But now I also requested manual review via
# https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/stores/snaps/ and
# https://dashboard.snapcraft.io/register-snap/
# 
# Not using `snaps=jas` because that's only allowed after the snap is created,
# but to do that, I first need to export the login.
#
# $ snapcraft export-login \
#      --acls package_access,package_push,package_update,package_release \
#      jas.secret
#
# For the first time, I went into an Ubuntu Hetzner image and ran:
# $ sudo apt update
# $ sudo apt install neovim
# $ sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
# $ git clone https://github.com/rikhuijzer/jas.git
# $ mv pkg/snapcraft.yaml .
# $ snapcraft # installs LXD at first run
# $ sudo apt install gnome-keyring
# $ snapcraft login
# $ snapcraft register jas
# $ snapcraft upload --release=edge jas_0.2.0_amd64.snap
