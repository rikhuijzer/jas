# This template contains all of the possible sections and their default values

# Note that all fields that take a lint level have these possible values:
# * deny - An error will be produced and the check will fail
# * warn - A warning will be produced, but the check will not fail
# * allow - No warning or error will be produced, though in some cases a note
# will be

# The values provided in this template are the default values that will be used
# when any section or field is not specified in your own configuration

# Root options

# The graph table configures how the dependency graph is constructed and thus
# which crates the checks are performed against
[graph]
# If 1 or more target triples (and optionally, target_features) are specified,
# only the specified targets will be checked when running `cargo deny check`.
# This means, if a particular package is only ever used as a target specific
# dependency, such as, for example, the `nix` crate only being used via the
# `target_family = "unix"` configuration, that only having windows targets in
# this list would mean the nix crate, as well as any of its exclusive
# dependencies not shared by any other crates, would be ignored, as the target
# list here is effectively saying which targets you are building for.

# When creating the dependency graph used as the source of truth when checks are
# executed, this field can be used to prune crates from the graph, removing them
# from the view of cargo-deny. This is an extremely heavy hammer, as if a crate
# is pruned from the graph, all of its dependencies will also be pruned unless
# they are connected to another crate in the graph that hasn't been pruned,
# so it should be used with care. The identifiers are [Package ID Specifications]
# (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/pkgid-spec.html)

# If true, metadata will be collected with `--all-features`. Note that this can't
# be toggled off if true, if you want to conditionally enable `--all-features` it
# is recommended to pass `--all-features` on the cmd line instead
all-features = false
# If true, metadata will be collected with `--no-default-features`. The same
# caveat with `all-features` applies
no-default-features = false
# If set, these feature will be enabled when collecting metadata. If `--features`
# is specified on the cmd line they will take precedence over this option.
#features = []

# The output table provides options for how/if diagnostics are outputted
[output]
# When outputting inclusion graphs in diagnostics that include features, this
# option can be used to specify the depth at which feature edges will be added.
# This option is included since the graphs can be quite large and the addition
# of features from the crate(s) to all of the graph roots can be far too verbose.
# This option can be overridden via `--feature-depth` on the cmd line
